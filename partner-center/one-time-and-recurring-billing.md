This topic describes the billing experience for **one-time and select recurring charges** for Microsoft and third-party independent software vendor (ISV) products. 

**One-time billing** is when you purchase software subscriptions and Azure reservations in advance for a preset term. You can purchase for one-year or three-year terms. You're then billed for the entire cost in a one-time lump sum.

Billing for one-time and select recurring charges applies to the following types of purchases:

- [License-based and usage-based subscriptions](#license-based-and-usage-based-subscription-charges)
- [Microsoft and third-party ISV products](#microsoft-and-third-party-isv-product-charges)

## <a name="license-based-and-usage-based-subscription-charges"></a>License-based and usage-based subscription charges

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The billing experience for recurring charges of [**license-based subscriptions**](license-based-billing.md) and [**usage-based subscriptions**](usage-based-billing.md) remains the same.

**Recurring charges** for subscriptions (including **license-based and usage-based subscriptions**) are issued for all products from the [**online services catalog**](https://partner.microsoft.com/commerce/preferredoffers/list). Some examples include Office 365, Microsoft 365, Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Azure (pay-as-you-go), Dynamics 365, and PowerBI Pro.

For applicable subscription charges, the **billing date** is the date you selected when you created your Partner Center account. The **billing period** is the month prior to your billing date.

The **billing currency** is the currency of the country or region in which you're located. Например, если ваша компания находится в Соединенном Королевстве, то мы будем выставлять вам счета в британских фунтах стерлингов (GBP). Если ваша компания находится в Индии, то мы будем выставлять вам счета в индийских рупиях (INR).

Current **billing activity** is *not available* for these types of charges.

## <a name="microsoft-and-third-party-isv-product-charges"></a>Microsoft and third-party ISV product charges

**Recurring charges** and **one-time charges** are issued for **Microsoft and third-party ISV products**. Applicable products include all SaaS subscriptions, Azure reservations, and perpetual and subscription-based software products offered by Microsoft and third-party ISVs. See available products in the Marketplace. Examples include SUSE Linux software (software subscriptions), Windows Server 2019 Essentials (perpetual software), and Azure ISV SaaS product subscriptions.

For applicable product charges, the **billing date** is the 8th day of each month. The **billing period** starts on the first day of the calendar month and ends on the last day of the calendar month. Any transactions you make between May 1 and May 31, 2019 will appear on your invoice June 8. Любые транзакции, выполненные с 1 по 31 июня 2019 года, отобразятся в счете 8 июля. Вам могут быть выставлены счета за повторяющиеся и одноразовые покупки в одном счете.

The **billing currency** is the currency of the country or region in which your customer is located. You’ll receive separate invoices and reconciliation files in the currency of the country or region of each customer that you sold to during the billing period.

Current **billing activity** is *available* for these types of charges. You can check your account balance and bill at any time in Partner Center. Note that your final invoice amount may different from what you can see on your account during the billing period. This is because your invoice will include taxes and any other applicable charges and credits.
